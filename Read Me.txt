This folder contains the necessary code to implement the proposed methodology.

For the logistic link, it is necessary to install the BayesLogit package in R. This package is no longer available
for download from CRAN, so we have provided the source files (BayesLogit_0.6.tar) for installation.

The subfolder (Chlamydia data) contains files that creates a fake chlamydia data set (Create_Fake_Data_Set.txt),
which is saved as (GT_Chlamydia_Data.csv), to mimic the Iowa group testing data set, and the necessary data 
structuring code and runs a complete analysis of the data set (Data_Analysis.txt).

Also included is two examples files, one for probit link (Example_probit.txt) and one for logistic link
(Example_logistic.txt), which simulates data from Dorfman's group testing algorithm and uses 
the Dirac spike code (GT_mixedmodel_Dirac.txt) to perform model fitting.

For the example code, i.e., 5000 individuals and Dorfman's group testing algorithm, the approximate time for model fitting is
	- 3.75 hours for Dirac spike
	- 3.25 hours for SSVS and NMIG
The computer specifications for these approximations are:
	- CPU: Intel Pentium G3240 @ 3.10 GHz
	- RAM: 4 GB DDR3
